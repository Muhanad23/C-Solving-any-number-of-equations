# C-Solving-any-number-of-equations
Solving any number of equations  using Gaussian elimination method , you can choose to see steps or no.
I didn't use any library , i made my own matrix class that deals with matrices , and used Gaussian elimination method to solve 
the equations after I put them in the matrices.
